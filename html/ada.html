        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>Ada is an eccentric bastard with a love for guts and sex (whether they're in the same occasion or not does vary), she always wants attention of all kind, trying to put herself at the center of situations for any reason she can find, she also has a very evident superioriy complex, deeming herself superior to everyone, especially men, she has no respect for men at all and genuinely thinks the earth would benefit from a lack of them, though she's still not actively trying to get rid of every single man on the planet.</p>
        <p>She seems to be constantly horny as well, any time is a good time to fuck she says, whether her word should be trusted or not is a whole other discussion, but she's constantly flirting with her coworkers, and not only her coworkers, she also has the luck of being very convincing, so that most of her attempts of seduction end well.</p>
        <p>A very skilled doctor as well, despite her unethical methods and general excitement around the rearranging of guts, actually! Her excitement about the rearranging of guts is what makes her particularly good, ethics isn't her problem, so unethical procedure aren't really a barrier.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Ada has always been out of control, completely weird, starting from a young age as well, already manifesting her love of guts by finding small animals she could open up and study, which got her labeled as a problematic kid and sent to therapy multiple times, therapy that extended also in her teen years and young adult years, both because of the persistent bloodlust and her talking about not being a man, but most likely a woman.</p>
        <p>Therapy seemed to have worked for a bit, but only a bit, Ada graduated med school and for her first few years she seemed to not be doing anything wrong, until many many cases of malpractice from her were discovered, people would wake up from surgeries just fine not knowing organs would have been stolen from them, and the remaining ones where rearranged and would have started to cause problems if not rearrenged back in place.</p>
        <p>Her medical license was revoked and she was arrested before she could run away, and to avoid having to spend life in jail, she pleaded insanity, she could take more therapy, the first round didn't work, the second wouldn't either, the mental facilty was worse than she could think, therapies were unethical and painful at times, she was constantly watched, kept under control 24/7, making her paranoid for months until she started to crave the attention, wanting to be watched at all times.</p>
        <p>She spent two years in there, after being discharged because deemed stable enough to be readmitted into society, at which she decided to move out of Germany, change first and last name, socially and medically transition into the woman she is now, working as a black market doctor and organ harvester until she was hired by MannCo, to work as the Medic in Team Castle</p>
        <p>During her years as an organ harvester, Ada decided to have a little of fun, striking a deal with the Devil only to ask him for some of his blood, with which she ended up distilling an elixir that she thought would make her immortal, but that instead started spreading an infection in her, making her turn into a demon once per full moon, now some people would feel guilty for the bloodlust this demon is in, Ada doesn't really mind, and enjoys her monthly transformation as well, after all, if she had witnesses while murdering someone as a demon, who would ever believe them?</p>
