    <h2 id="ivy">Ivy</h2>
    <p>Ivy is the oldest of Nickie's daughters, she's 6 and constantly in need for adventure, she's jittery and permanently excited, outgoing and friendly, but also a little reckless, causing her mother some scares here and there, and just like Nickie she's protective of her little sister, not wanting her to be hurt or scared, she adores Emelee and Missy, often bothering them to plau, but she's a little scared by Ada (generally afraid of doctors), she has been taught to swordfight by Xiomara, which wasn't a great idea actually because she's constantly challenging everyone to a duel if there's need to settle an argument or similar, she's lovely though, the team loves her.</p>

    <h2 id="liz">Lizzie</h2>
    <p>Elizabeth, Lizzie for short, is Ivy's younger sister, she's 4 and she's still taking in everything that happened with her parents, she is shy and often seen hiding behind Nickie's skirt, she's very sensitive and easily scared, she's yet to make friends with any of the teammates, but seems particularly comfortable with Elspeth and Rosie, Rosie even gifted her a teddy bear and now Lizzie can't do without it, she brings it everywhere and will get nervous without it, the team loves her as well, though she tends to refrain from any affection from them.</p>
