    <h2 id="nursecare">Nurse's care</h2>
    <p>A standard MannCo's crossbow modified so its darts contain Uberfluid, while hitting an enemy makes little to no difference, hitting an ally will power them up, giving them the UberKrietz effect for a few seconds, plus, hitting an enemy on the head will instantly crit, though it won't do any random crits</p>

    <h2 id="uberkrietz">The Uberkrietz</h2>
    <p>A powerful medigun built from scratch, though healing at a slower pace, it boosts damage too by a little, and charges up 50% faster than the standard medigun, and when completely charged and deployed gives mini-crits and a susteinably high overheal, other than higher damage resistance</p>

    <h2 id="prescription">Doctor's prescription</h2>
    <p>A large syringe with an even larger needle, filled with poisonous fluid, normally it works as any other melee weapon, stabbing enemies with it without injecting anything in them, but hitting an enemy's head from behind causes Ada to inject the fluid in them, killing the enemy on hit, just like a backstab</p>

    <h2 id="bite">Widow's Bite</h2>
    <p>An hand-crafted gun that shoots darts full of powerful poison that blinds and confuses the enemy, but tends to not kill, only cause as much suffering as possible, hitting an enemy doesn't deal as much damage immediately, but it'll render the enemy blind for a few seconds as well as drastically slowing them down and poisoning them for another good amount of time, time of blindness and poison stacks up to four shots landed</p>

    <h2 id="sapper">Mannco's not-so-standard sapper</h2>
    <p>A modified standard sapper, that temporarily turns an enemy building into a friendly one, but only for a limited amount of time, cause the sapper will destroy itself after a little, if used on Rosie's mech suit it allows Elspeth to get in and use it until the sapper destroys itself and she is ejected from the mech</p>

    <h2 id="case">Vintage case</h2>
    <p>Works almost as normal as a regular disguise kit, with a core difference, in fact if hit while disguised, you'll activate the effect of the Bait and Switch, effectively giving a chance to counterattack</p>

    <h2 id="baitnswitch">Bait and Switch</h2>
    <p>A pocket watch that if activated and in front of an enemy, leaves a doll of Elspeth in front of the enemy while teleporting her behind them, giving a chance to escape or counterattack</p>

    <img class="left" src="https://via.placeholder.com/200">
    <h2 id="pin">The Hatpin</h2>
    <p>A long and sharp pin used to keep hats in place, but that Elspeth wears in her hair, all cool and intricate but it works just like a regular knife, being able to backstab and all</p>
