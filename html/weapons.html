    <p>A standard MannCo's crossbow modified so its darts contain Uberfluid, while hitting an enemy makes little to no difference, hitting an ally will power them up, giving them the UberKrietz effect for a few seconds, plus, hitting an enemy on the head will instantly crit, though it won't do any random crits</p>

    <p>A powerful medigun built from scratch, though healing at a slower pace, it boosts damage too by a little, and charges up 50% faster than the standard medigun, and when completely charged and deployed gives mini-crits and a susteinably high overheal, other than higher damage resistance</p>

    <h2 id="prescription">Doctor's prescription</h2>
    <p>A large syringe with an even larger needle, filled with poisonous fluid, normally it works as any other melee weapon, stabbing enemies with it without injecting anything in them, but hitting an enemy's head from behind causes Ada to inject the fluid in them, killing the enemy on hit, just like a backstab</p>
