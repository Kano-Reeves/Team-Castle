        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>"Murder is a natural cause" is probably the best phrase to describe Elspeth, a bloodthirsty sadistic woman whose ultimate goal is to cause suffering in others, despite that, she's pretty pleasant to have around if she likes you or is pretending to like you before handing you a cup of poisoned tea.</p>
        <p>She's a good friends if she's trying, though her advice usually includes murder so it's better to not follow her advice very often, she'd be glad to dispense absolutely horrible advice thought, always up to help a friend, especially with murdering anyone.</p>
        <p>But also, Elspeth is a crafter and lover of aestethics, making most of her things from scratch, she's pretty skilled in a lot of things, sewing, embroidery, weapon crafting, weapon modding, smithing, gardening and many others, a fairly wide range of skill, mostly put into making her equipment as perfect as possible and perfected enough to cause others to bleed and suffer as much as possible before dying</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Though Elspeth can be <i>very</i> talkative at times, not much is known about her past, in fact we have no records either of her childhood or teen years, even though we know she was pressured into her first marriage, and that she couldn't stand her husband at all (reasons including but not limited to her general disregard of men), the man died an year and an half later, of <i>natural causes</i></p>
        <p>She moved on extremely quick for being so young and already widowed, in fact she remarried just under a year later, this time out of her own will, but strangely to another man she despised, who coincidentally also died months later of <i>natural causes</i></p>
        <p>For <i>unknown reasons</i> she left scotland and moved out to the US, where she ended up working for MannCo, the reason is unknown for this too</p>
