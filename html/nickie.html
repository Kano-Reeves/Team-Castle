            <h4>Info</h4>
            <p><b>Full name:</b> Nicole Valis</p>
            <p><b>Age:</b> 41</p>
            <p><b>Pronouns:</b> She/Her</p>
            <p><b>Sexuality:</b> Bisexual</p>
            <p><b>Place of birth:</b> US</p>

        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>A mom, she's sweet and adorable, Nickie loves to care but actually also needs to be cared for, even though she won't admit it, she's protective and responsible, she'd do anything to protect those she loves, even get violent and kill</p>
        <p>Even though she's willing to get violent to protect the innocent, she tends to crumble afterwards, feeling guilty and upset about any violence but just afterwards, after all is done, she breaks down and and feels guilty</p>
        <p>She's not particularly violence-inclined, preferring verbal confrontation that a physical one, but working at Mannco made her just a little more violence-inclined, a little more likely to deck the shit out of someone if angry and provoked, or well, just for her work, she got to a point where picking up her minigun doesn't bother her anymore, the death isn't permanent</p>
        <p>Nickie is super attached to her ideals, and is unmovable about them, but she won't bother explaining to your that you're wrong, she'll keep standing by them and reasoning by them, and not listening to you.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>There isn't much to Nickie's backstory, she doesn't hide it, but most of it isn't particularly interesting, she had led a quiet life for most of her life, she had a stable job, a nice house, and an husband that she loved, or well, an husband she used to love, they had started having issues after their marriage, the husband started drinking and become violent, and Nickie always more stressed by caring for everything.</p>
        <p>It was when kids came that things started to go downhill, Nickie still clung to her kindness and withstood her husband, but the second that the man tried to do anything to one of her daughters, she snapped, and killed him in a fit of rage, and in the same occasion, the three cops that were called to arrest her, she took the two children and fled the town, and had been on the run for months until she was hired at Mannco, it promised her legal protection and a place to stay, and well, it's not the best, but <a href="npcs.html#ivy">Ivy</a> and <a href="npcs.html#liz">Lizzie</a> are safe for now, it's something</p>
